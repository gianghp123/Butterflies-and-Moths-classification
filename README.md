# BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS IMAGE CLASSIFICATION

This project focuses on the classification of butterfly species using deep learning techniques.
The goal is to build a robust pretrained-model capable of accurately identifying different species of butterflies based on images.
The project involves training a neural network on a labeled dataset of butterfly images, optimizing the model, and evaluating its performance.

* Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/butterfly-images40-species <br>
  * Train set consists of 12594 images partitioned into 100 sub directories one for each species.<br>
  * Test set consists of 500 images partitioned into 100 sub directories with 5 test images per species.<br>
  * Valid set consists of 500 images partitioned into 100 sub directories with 5 validation images per species.<br>

The accuracy on test set is **97.5%**.
